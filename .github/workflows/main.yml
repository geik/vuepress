# events but only for the master branch

jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Docker build has been moved to dockerhub
      run: echo "Docker build has been moved to dockerhub"

    # - name: Build the image
    #   run: |-
    #     docker build --tag geik/vuepress:latest --tag geik/vuepress:1.0.0 .
        
    # - name: Publish the image
    #   run: |-
